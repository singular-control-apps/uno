# uno
Uno is a Simple Control application focused on doing One thing - getting a single or group of graphics on air quickly. It is targeted at users who do not need to control overlays during their stream. They basically set the information in the overlay, and leave it on for the duration of their stream. There are no pages/payloads. The Fill-In form synchronizes directly with Firebase.
